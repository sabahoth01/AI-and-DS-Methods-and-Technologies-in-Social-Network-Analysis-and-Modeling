# Project

Analysis of User Behavior Trends:

- Study user behavior over time by analyzing how interactions change following specific events (e.g., holidays, major news).
- Use time series analysis to model and forecast engagement metrics such as likes, shares, and comments.
- Combine with sentiment analysis and analyse how sentitments change following specofoc events "

## steps

- [ ] Define Project Objectives

Identify the specific research questions and objectives for your project, such as:
1. How do user interactions change following specific events (e.g., holidays, major news)?
2. Can time series analysis accurately forecast engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments)?
3. How do sentiments change following specific events?
- [ ] Collect and Preprocess Data

Choose a dataset or API to collect Twitter or VK data (as discussed earlier).
Preprocess the data by:
1. Handling missing values and outliers
2. Normalizing or scaling the data
3. Transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.
- [ ] Conduct Time Series Analysis

1. Use time series analysis techniques, such as:
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models
- Exponential Smoothing (ES) models
- Prophet library
2. Analyze the engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) over time to identify patterns and trends.
- [ ] Conduct Sentiment Analysis

1. Use sentiment analysis techniques, such as:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
2. Analyze the sentiments expressed in tweets or VK posts to identify changes following specific events.
- [ ] Combine Time Series and Sentiment Analysis

Combine the results of time series analysis and sentiment analysis to identify how sentiments change following specific events.
Visualize the results using plots and charts to illustrate the trends and patterns.
- [ ] Evaluate and Refine the Model

Evaluate the performance of the time series and sentiment analysis models using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and accuracy.
Refine the models by tuning hyperparameters, experimenting with different techniques, and incorporating additional features.
- [ ] Present the Results

Prepare a clear and concise report or presentation to communicate the findings and insights from the project.
Visualize the results using plots, charts, and tables to illustrate the trends and patterns.
